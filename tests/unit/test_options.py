r"""Unit tests for options_with_automatic_retry function.

This file contains tests that are specific to the OPTIONS HTTP method.
Common tests across all HTTP methods are in test_core.py.

Note: OPTIONS requests are used to query supported methods and headers.
The core tests cover all the retry logic and error handling. Currently,
there are no OPTIONS-specific tests needed beyond what's in test_core.py.

from __future__ import annotations

# No OPTIONS-specific tests needed at this time.
# All core functionality is tested in test_core.py with parametrized tests.
